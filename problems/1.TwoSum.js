/**
 * Problem
 * Given an array of integers "nums"
 * and an integer "target"
 * return "indices" of the two
 * numbers such that they add up
 * to "target".
 *
 * You may assume that each input
 * would have exactly one solution
 * and you may not use the same
 * element twice.
 *
 * You can return the answer
 * in any order.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1
 * ---------------0 1 2  3
 * input: nums = [2,7,11,5], target = 9
 * output: [0,1]
 * explanation:
 * nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
 * => return [0,1]
 *
 * Example 2
 * input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
 * output:
 *
 *
